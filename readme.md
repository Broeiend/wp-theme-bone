#### Notes CSS naming conventions

**Don'ts:**

1. Naming classes based on aesthetics: `.skyblue`, `.primary-green`. 
*As the design changes, these variable names will increase complexity for making rapid changes.*
2. 

**Do's:**

1. Content-independent class names.
2. Class names should communicate useful information to developers.
