## Wordpress bone structure

Requirements: 
+ [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) 
+ [Sass gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/sass) 
+ [Susy gem](http://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=susy)  

-or-

+ [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) *(which contains all of the above)*

### OOCSS/SASS Architecture

**Normalize** (included in functions.php enqueued css) = HTML 5 ready alternative to CSS reset. See [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

1. **css3** (compass include) = Cross-browser mixins for CSS properties introduced in CSS3. See [Compass CSS3](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/)
2. **susy** (compass include) = Grid structure. See [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/guides/#start-basic)
3. **base** (_base.scss) = These are the defaults. Almost exlusively single element selectors.
4. **layout** (_layout.scss) = Divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together. Defining the grid. 
5. **modules** (_modules.scss) = The reusable, modular parts of the design. They are the callouts, sidebar sections, product lists etc.

1 t/m 5 are compiled (output_style:compressed) into style.css

*Note: Css architecture based on SMACSS: http://smacss.com/*

> The purpose of OOCSS is to encourage code reuse and, ultimately, faster and more efficient stylesheets taht are easier to add and maintain.

## Notes on Front-end architecture

Terms:
- **SMACSS** - **S**calable and **M**odular **A**rcitecture for **CSS** is not a framework, but more a style guide. 
- **OOCSS** - **O**bject **O**riented **CSS**
- **Semantic classes** - 
- **Presentational classes** -
- **Aestetic classes** - 


### Don'ts:

1. Use classes rather than ID's for styling purposes. (The whole point for CSS is to create a Cascading Style Sheet)
2. Naming classes based on aesthetics: `.skyblue`, `.primary-green`, '.orange.bold', 'buttonBig'. 
*As the design changes, these variable names will increase complexity for making rapid changes. If your class is called "blue" and you want to change it to red, you also have to edit the html.* 
Instead use: '.warning', 'primary', 'submenu', etc.


### Do's:

1. Content-independent class names.

2. Abstract class names. 
*To make a text stand out of smaller text you might choose `<div class="largeText"></div>`. This is unsemantic. It is specifying. `<div class="stand_out"></div>` might be better here. Maybe in the future you may wish to choose a different style to make that text stand out that has nothing to do with the size of the text.*

3. Class names should communicate useful information to developers.

4. "Multi-class" patterns in combination with using @extends:

> If we have this html:

> ```
<button class="btn">Default</button>
<button class="btn-primary">Login</button>
<button class="btn-danger">Delete</button>
```

> Sass:

> ```
%btn {
    padding:10px 15px;
    font-size:12px;
}
.btn {
    @extend %btn;
}
.btn-primary {
    @extend %btn;
    background-color:green;
}
.btn-danger {
    @extend %btn;
    background-color:red;
}

> ```
*Note the `%`. Which is called the* [placeholder selector](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholders).

> Outputs this CSS:

> ```
.btn, .btn-primary, .btn-danger {
  padding: 10px 15px;
  font-size: 12px;
}
.btn-primary {
  background-color: green;
}
.btn-danger {
  background-color: red;
}
```
